\title{Box Area Calculation (Rcpp demonstration)}
\usage{
box_area_fast(boxes)
}
\arguments{
\item{boxes}{Matrix (N x 4) with box coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2), or
torch tensor (will be converted to matrix)}
}
\value{
Vector of areas (or torch tensor if input was torch tensor)
}
\description{
Alternative C++ implementation of box area calculation. This demonstrates
Rcpp integration and provides a performance boost for very large batches
(N > 100k boxes) when working with plain matrices instead of torch tensors.
}
\details{
For most use cases, the standard \code{\link{box_area}} function is recommended.
This C++ version is useful when:
\itemize{
\item Working with very large matrices (N > 100k)
\item Input is already a plain R matrix
\item Avoiding torch overhead is important
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# For normal use, prefer box_area()
boxes_tensor <- torch_tensor(matrix(c(0,0,10,10), ncol=4))
box_area(boxes_tensor)

# This function is faster for large plain matrices
boxes_matrix <- matrix(runif(1e6 * 4), ncol=4)
box_area_fast(boxes_matrix)
}

}
