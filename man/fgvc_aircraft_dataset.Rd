\usage{
fgvc_aircraft_dataset(
  root = tempdir(),
  split = "train",
  annotation_level = "variant",
  transform = NULL,
  target_transform = NULL,
  download = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{root}{Character. Root directory for dataset storage. The dataset will be stored under \verb{root/fgvc-aircraft-2013b}.}

\item{split}{Character. One of \code{"train"}, \code{"val"}, \code{"trainval"}, or \code{"test"}. Default is \code{"train"}.}

\item{annotation_level}{Character. Level of annotation to use for classification.
One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"variant"}: the most fine-grained level, e.g., \code{"Boeing 737-700"}. There are 100 visually distinguishable aircraft variants.
\item \code{"family"}: a mid-level grouping, e.g., \code{"Boeing 737"}, which includes multiple variants. There are 70 distinct families.
\item \code{"manufacturer"}: the coarsest level, e.g., \code{"Boeing"}, grouping multiple families under a single aircraft manufacturer. There are 30 manufacturers.
}

Note: These levels form a strict hierarchy:
each \code{"manufacturer"} consists of multiple \code{"families"}, and each \code{"family"} contains several \code{"variants"}.
Not all combinations of levels are valid â€” for example, a \code{"variant"} always belongs to exactly one \code{"family"},
and a \code{"family"} always belongs to exactly one \code{"manufacturer"}. You cannot mix or arbitrarily combine levels.

Default is \code{"variant"}.}

\item{transform}{Optional function to transform input images after loading.}

\item{target_transform}{Optional function to transform labels.}

\item{download}{Logical. Whether to download the dataset if not found locally. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{fgvc_aircraft_dataset} object, which is a torch-style dataset.
Each element is a named list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{x}: the image as a 3D torch tensor (C x H x W), already converted using \code{transform_to_tensor()}, unlike most torchvision-style datasets where images are returned as PIL objects.
\item \code{y}: an integer class label corresponding to the selected \code{annotation_level}.
}

The dataset supports standard dataset operations like indexing (\code{dataset[i]}) and length (\code{length(dataset)}).

\description{
FGVC Aircraft Dataset
}
\details{
Loads the FGVC Aircraft Dataset, a dataset of aircraft images with multiple annotation levels:
\itemize{
\item "variant": fine-grained aircraft variants (e.g., specific model variants)
\item "family": aircraft families
\item "manufacturer": aircraft manufacturers
}

The dataset supports the following splits:
\itemize{
\item \code{"train"}: training subset (simulated from \code{"trainval"})
\item \code{"val"}: validation subset (simulated from \code{"trainval"})
\item \code{"trainval"}: full training + validation set (as provided by the official dataset)
\item \code{"test"}: test set with labels
}

Note: The original dataset provides \code{"trainval"} and \code{"test"} splits. The \code{"train"} and \code{"val"} subsets are simulated from \code{"trainval"} by an 80/20 split with a fixed random seed.
