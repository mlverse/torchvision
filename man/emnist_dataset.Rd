\title{EMNIST (Balanced Split) Dataset}
\usage{
emnist_dataset(
  root,
  train = TRUE,
  transform = NULL,
  target_transform = NULL,
  download = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{root}{Character. Root directory where the dataset is stored or will be downloaded to.
The dataset files will be located under \verb{root/EMNIST/processed/}.}

\item{train}{Logical, default \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, creates dataset from the training split, otherwise from the test split.}

\item{transform}{Optional function. A transformation to apply to the input images.
Should accept an image and return a transformed version.}

\item{target_transform}{Optional function. A transformation to apply to the target labels.}

\item{download}{Logical, default \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, downloads the dataset if not already present in \code{root}.}
}
\value{
An EMNIST Balanced dataset object containing images and labels.
}
\description{
Prepares and loads the EMNIST Balanced split dataset.
The EMNIST Balanced split contains digits and uppercase/lowercase letters
from the Extended MNIST dataset, organized into training and test subsets.
}
\details{
The dataset files are downloaded from the official EMNIST repository if not already available.
The raw files are processed and cached in \verb{root/EMNIST/processed/} for faster loading.
The labels correspond to digits and letters as per the EMNIST Balanced mapping.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create the EMNIST Balanced training dataset, downloading if needed
ds <- emnist_dataset(train = TRUE, download = TRUE)

# Access the first image and label
sample <- ds[1]
image <- sample[[1]]
label <- sample[[2]]

# Print image dimensions and label
print(dim(image))  # Expected: 28x28
print(label)
}
