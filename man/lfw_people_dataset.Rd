\usage{
lfw_people_dataset(
  root,
  split = "train",
  image_set = "deepfunneled",
  transform = NULL,
  target_transform = NULL,
  download = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{root}{Character. Root directory for dataset storage. The dataset will be stored under \code{root/lfw_people}.}

\item{split}{Character. Either \code{"train"} or \code{"test"}. Indicates which subset to load.}

\item{image_set}{Character. Type of image preprocessing to use. Must be one of \code{"deepfunneled"}, \code{"funneled"}, or \code{"original"}.
Default is \code{"deepfunneled"}.}

\item{transform}{Optional function to transform input images after loading.}

\item{target_transform}{Optional function to transform labels.}

\item{download}{Logical. Whether to download the dataset if not found locally. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An \code{lfw_people_dataset} object representing the dataset, with fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{x}: image tensor (250x250x3 RGB).
\item \code{y}: class name as a string (person's name).
}
}
\description{
Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) People Dataset
}
\details{
Loads the LFW People Dataset, a collection of face photographs designed for studying unconstrained face recognition.
Each person in the dataset has multiple images, and each image is labeled with the corresponding person's name.
Supports image subsets: "deepfunneled", "funneled", and "original". Images are automatically split into training and test subsets.

first_item <- lfw[1]
# RGB image of the first face
first_item$x
# Name of the person
first_item$y
